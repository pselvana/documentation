The following new features are included in version 23.2. For a complete list of updates, see the [Redpanda release notes](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases/tag/v23.2.1).

## Follower fetching

Follower fetching lets a consumer fetch records from the closest replica of a topic partition, regardless of whether it's a leader or a follower. This can minimize costs and consumer read latency for clusters deployed across different data centers and availability zones. See https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/develop/consume-data/follower-fetching/ 

## Server-side schema ID validation

With this enterprise feature, records produced to a topic may use a serializer/deserializer client library, such as Confluent's SerDes library, to encode their keys and values according to a schema in Schema Registry. Schema ID validation enables brokers (servers) to detect and drop records that were produced with an incorrectly configured subject name strategy, that don't conform to the SerDes wire format, or that encode an incorrect schema ID. With schema ID validation, records associated with unregistered schemas are detected and dropped earlier, by a broker rather than a consumer. See https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/manage/schema-id-validation/#about-schema-id-validation 

## Tiered Storage updates

As data in object storage grows, the metadata for it grows. To support efficient long-term data retention, Redpanda splits the metadata in object storage, storing metadata of only recently-updated segments, and safely archiving the remaining metadata in object storage and caching it locally on disk. Archived metadata can be loaded when historical data is accessed. This allows Tiered Storage to handle partitions of virtually any size.

- Fine-grained caching: To support more concurrent consumers of historical data with less local storage, Redpanda can download small chunks of remote segments from the cache directory. For example, when a client fetch request spans a subsection of a 1 GiB segment, instead of downloading the entire 1 GiB segment, Redpanda can download 16 MiB chunks that contain just enough data required to fulfill the fetch request. See https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/manage/tiered-storage/#caching

- Automatic disk space management: Redpanda now divides disk storage into different categories to provide a flexible configuration of space: reserved disk space, cache storage, and log storage. When data usage begins to approach the target size of log storage, Redpanda does local storage housekeeping to bring usage back under the target size. The allows Redpanda to leverages available local storage safely, efficiently, and automatically. See https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization/#local-storage-housekeeping 

- View space usage: You can now use `rpk cluster logdirs describe` to get details about Tiered Storage space usage. The directories for object storage start with `remote://<bucket_name>`. See https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/manage/tiered-storage/#view-space-usage

## Controller snapshots

Redpanda now loads the controller log from a snapshot on startup. Controller snapshots save the current cluster metadata state to disk, which significantly improves startup times of nodes in long-running Redpanda clusters. For example, with a partition that has moved several times, a snapshot can restore the latest state without replaying every move command. See https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/get-started/architecture/#controller-partition-and-snapshots

## Delete records from a topicâ€‹

Redpanda now lets you delete data from the beginning of a partition up to a specific offset (event). The offset represents the true creation time of the event, not the time when it was stored by Redpanda. Deleting records frees up disk space, which is especially helpful if your producers are pushing more data than you anticipated in your retention plan. There are different ways to delete records from a topic, including using the `rpk topic trim` command or using the DeleteRecords Kafka API with Kafka clients. See https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/develop/config-topics/#delete-records-from-a-topic 

## Topic-aware leadership balancer

The new `leader_balancer_mode` property ensures that each shard in a cluster has an equal number of partitions. It determines the movement of leadership for the replica set of a partition. As an alternative to Redpanda partition balancing, you can change partition assignments explicitly with the Kafka API or with any 3rd-party tool in the Kafka ecosystem that controls partition movement using the Kafka API. See https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/manage/cluster-maintenance/cluster-balancing/#partition-leadership-balancing

## Changes to local retention behavior

With this release, both size-based and time-based retention policies are applied simultaneously, so it's possible for your size-based property to override your time-based property, or vice versa. For example, if your size-based property requires removing one segment, and your time-based property requires removing three segments, then three segments are removed. Size-based properties reclaim disk space as close as possible to the maximum size, without exceeding the limit. See https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization/#configure-message-retention

## Client throughput quotas

You can now manage the throughput of Kafka traffic at the cluster level, with configurable properties that limit and protect the use of disk and network resources for individual nodes and for an entire cluster. See https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/manage/cluster-maintenance/manage-throughput/

## Kubernetes Operator

To deploy Redpanda in Kubernetes, you can choose to use Helm for its simplicity, or you can combine Helm with the Redpanda Operator to leverage custom resource definitions (CRDs) for a more GitOps-friendly deployment process. Redpanda Operator is the recommended deployment option. See https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/deploy/deployment-option/self-hosted/kubernetes/kubernetes-production-deployment/ 

## rpk updates

rpk profiles: Users can manage multiple Redpanda clusters from rpk; for example, you can switch between clusters (dev/prod) from their rpk client. This is a shell experience that standardizes and accelerates work on multiple clusters.

## Admin API

See https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/api/admin-api/

## Automated deployment updates

Simplifed deployment using automated tools like Terraform and Ansible.

See https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/deploy/deployment-option/self-hosted/manual/production/production-deployment-automation/

## Repdanda Cloud updates

Self-service experience for setting up and running managed connectors. Redpanda also supports higher throughput tiers (400 MB ingress / 800 MB egress).

See https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/deploy/deployment-option/cloud/managed-connectors/
