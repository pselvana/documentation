The following new features are included in version 23.2. For a complete list of updates, see the [Redpanda release notes](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases/tag/v23.2.1).

## Follower fetching

[Follower fetching](../../develop/consume-data/follower-fetching) lets a consumer fetch records from the closest replica of a topic partition, regardless of whether it's a leader or a follower. This can minimize costs and consumer read latency for clusters deployed across different data centers and availability zones.

## Server-side schema ID validation

With this enterprise feature, records produced to a topic may use a serializer/deserializer client library, such as Confluent's SerDes library, to encode their keys and values according to a schema in Schema Registry. [Schema ID validation](../../manage/schema-id-validation) enables brokers to detect and drop records that were produced with an incorrectly configured subject name strategy, that don't conform to the SerDes wire format, or that encode an incorrect schema ID. Records associated with unregistered schemas are detected and dropped earlier, by a broker rather than a consumer. 

## Tiered Storage enhancements

As data in object storage grows, the metadata for it grows. To support efficient long-term data retention, Redpanda splits the metadata in object storage, storing metadata of only recently-updated segments, and safely archiving the remaining metadata in object storage and caching it locally on disk. Archived metadata can be loaded when historical data is accessed. This allows Tiered Storage to handle partitions of virtually any size.

- [Fine-grained caching](../../manage/tiered-storage/#caching): To support more concurrent consumers of historical data with less local storage, Redpanda can download small chunks of remote segments from the cache directory. For example, when a client fetch request spans a subsection of a 1 GiB segment, instead of downloading the entire 1 GiB segment, Redpanda can download 16 MiB chunks that contain just enough data required to fulfill the fetch request.

- [Automatic disk space management](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization/#local-storage-housekeeping): Redpanda now divides disk storage into different categories to provide a flexible configuration of space: reserved disk space, cache storage, and log storage. When data usage begins to approach the target size of log storage, Redpanda does local storage housekeeping to bring usage back under the target size. This allows Redpanda to leverage available local storage safely and efficiently. 

- [View space usage](../../manage/tiered-storage/#view-space-usage): You can now use `rpk cluster logdirs describe` to get details about Tiered Storage space usage. 

## Controller snapshots

Redpanda now loads the controller log from a snapshot on startup. [Controller snapshots](../architecture/#controller-partition-and-snapshots) save the current cluster metadata state to disk, which significantly improves startup times of nodes in long-running Redpanda clusters. For example, with a partition that has moved several times, a snapshot can restore the latest state without replaying every move command. 

## Delete records from a topic​

Redpanda now lets you [delete data from the beginning of a partition up to a specific offset](../../develop/config-topics/#delete-records-from-a-topic). The offset represents the true creation time of the event, not the time when it was stored by Redpanda. Deleting records frees up disk space, which is especially helpful if your producers are pushing more data than you anticipated in your retention plan. There are different ways to delete records from a topic, including using the `rpk topic trim` command or using the DeleteRecords Kafka API with Kafka clients.

## Topic-aware leadership balancing

The new [`leader_balancer_mode`](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/cluster-balancing/#partition-leadership-balancing) property ensures that each shard in a cluster has an equal number of partitions. It determines the movement of leadership for the replica set of a partition. As an alternative to Redpanda partition balancing, you can change partition assignments explicitly with the Kafka API or with any 3rd-party tool in the Kafka ecosystem that controls partition movement using the Kafka API.

## Local message retention

With this release, both size-based and time-based [retention policies](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization/#configure-message-retention) are applied simultaneously, so it's possible for your size-based property to override your time-based property, or vice versa. For example, if your size-based property requires removing one segment, and your time-based property requires removing three segments, then three segments are removed. Size-based properties reclaim disk space as close as possible to the maximum size, without exceeding the limit. 

## Client throughput quotas

You can now [manage the throughput](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/manage-throughput/) of Kafka traffic at the cluster level, with configurable properties that limit and protect the use of disk and network resources for individual nodes and for an entire cluster.

## Kubernetes Operator

Redpanda offers a new approach to deploying [Redpanda in Kubernetes](../../deploy/deployment-option/self-hosted/kubernetes/kubernetes-production-deployment/). You can choose to use Helm for its simplicity, or you can combine Helm with the Redpanda Operator to leverage custom resource definitions (CRDs) for a more GitOps-friendly deployment process. Redpanda Operator is the recommended deployment option.

## rpk commands

- [`rpk profile`](../../reference/rpk/rpk-profile/): This allows users to switch between clusters seamlessly.
- [`rpk cloud login`](../../reference/rpk/rpk-cloud/rpk-cloud-login/): This allows users to connect to cloud environments by browser.
- [`rpk topic trim-prefix`](../../reference/rpk/rpk-topic/rpk-topic-trim-prefix/): This allows users to delete records from a topic.
- [`rpk topic describe-storage`](../../reference/rpk/rpk-topic/rpk-topic-describe-storage/): This provides detailed information about storage, including local and object disk usage and time of last write to object storage.

## Redpanda Console TLS termination

To secure Redpanda Console using TLS, you can either let Redpanda Console handle TLS termination or you can offload it to an upstream component, such as a reverse proxy or a Cloud HTTPS LoadBalancer. [TLS termination](../../manage/security/console/tls-termination) refers to the process of decrypting incoming TLS-encrypted traffic. 

## Repdanda Cloud

Redpanda [managed connectors](../../deploy/deployment-option/cloud/managed-connectors/) are fully-managed solutions for integrating different data systems with your real-time clusters in Redpanda Cloud. They remove the need for manually building integrations with the Kafka API or Kafka Connect, and they’re available in the Redpanda Console. 

:::note
Redpanda Cloud releases new features on a continuous basis and uptakes Redpanda platform (self-hosted) versions.

## New documentation

The following sections are new in our documentation:

- [Admin API](../../api/admin-api/)
- [Topic configuration properties](../../reference/topic-properties)
- [Intro to rpk](../intro-to-rpk)
- [Benchmark Redpanda](../../develop/benchmark)

## Simplified automated deployment

Redpanda [automated deployment](../../deploy/deployment-option/self-hosted/manual/production/production-deployment-automation/) using Terraform and Ansible has been enhanced. Terraform can set up the infrastructure and output a properly-formatted `hosts.ini` file, and Ansible can use that `hosts.ini` file as input to install Redpanda. If you already have an infrastructure provisioning framework, you can supply your own hosts file (without using Terraform) and use Ansible to install Redpanda. For unique configurations, you can work directly with the Ansible and Terraform modules to integrate them into your environment. This provides a production-usable way to deploy and maintain a cluster.
